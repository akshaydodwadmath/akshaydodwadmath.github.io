Hello! I am Akshay, a PhD student at Ruhr-Universität Bochum, advised by Dr. 
<a href="https://etit.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en/lts/team/prof-dr-ing-setareh-maghsudi/"> Setareh Maghsudi </a>. I 
am interesting in pushing the boundaries of human knowledge in Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning. 

Previously, I have done a Master degree in Computer Science at Saarland University. During this time,
I worked on my thesis at <a href="https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/index.html">Machine Teaching Group</a> at the <a href="https://www.mpi-sws.org/">Max Planck Institute of Software Systems </a> under the supervision of Dr. <a href="https://www.mpi-sws.org/people/adishs/">Adish Singla </a>. My thesis topic was "Towards Synthesizing Qualitative and Diverse Programs for Block-Based Visual Programming". See [here](http://akshaydodwadmath.github.io/files/Akshay_Thesis.pdf) for more details.

I have also worked on a research project at <a href="https://cispa.de/en/">CISPA</a> under the supervision of Dr. <a href="https://cispa.de/en/people/c01sest">Sebastian Stich</a> in the domain of privacy-preserving machine learning. See our paper <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=NvlUqen8Cya">here</a> for more details.
