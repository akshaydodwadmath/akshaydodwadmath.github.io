Hello! I am a Master's in Computer Science student at Saarland University. The focus of my degree has been on AI-related subjects such as Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning. 

I have done my thesis at <a href="https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/index.html">Machine Teaching Group</a> at the <a href="https://www.mpi-sws.org/">Max Planck Institute of Software Systems </a> under the supervision of Dr. <a href="https://www.mpi-sws.org/people/adishs/">Adish Singla </a>. My thesis topic was "Towards Synthesizing Qualitative and Diverse Programs for Block-Based Visual Programming", and involved techniques of neural program synthesis and reinforcement learning.

During my degree, I have also worked on a research project at <a href="https://cispa.de/en/">CISPA</a> under the supervision of Dr. <a href="https://cispa.de/en/people/c01sest">Sebastian Stich</a> in the domain of privacy-preserving machine learning. See our paper <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=NvlUqen8Cya">here</a> for more details.
